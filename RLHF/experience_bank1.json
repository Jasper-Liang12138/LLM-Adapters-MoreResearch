Carolyn and Paul are playing a game starting with a list of the integers $1$ to $n.$ The rules of the game are: $\\bullet$ Carolyn always has the first turn. $\\bullet$ Carolyn and Paul alternate turns. $\\bullet$ On each of her turns, Carolyn must remove one number from the list such that this number has at least one positive divisor other than itself remaining in the list. $\\bullet$ On each of his turns, Paul must remove from the list all of the positive divisors of the number that Carolyn has just removed. $\\bullet$ If Carolyn cannot remove any more numbers, then Paul removes the rest of the numbers. For example, if $n=6,$ a possible sequence of moves is shown in this chart: \\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline Player & Removed \\# & \\# remaining \\\\ \\hline Carolyn & 4 & 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 \\\\ \\hline Paul & 1, 2 & 3, 5, 6 \\\\ \\hline Carolyn & 6 & 3, 5 \\\\ \\hline Paul & 3 & 5 \\\\ \\hline Carolyn & None & 5 \\\\ \\hline Paul & 5 & None \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} Note that Carolyn can't remove $3$ or $5$ on her second turn, and can't remove any number on her third turn. In this example, the sum of the numbers removed by Carolyn is $4+6=10$ and the sum of the numbers removed by Paul is $1+2+3+5=11.$ Suppose that $n=6$ and Carolyn removes the integer $2$ on her first turn. Determine the sum of the numbers that Carolyn removes.

Please take the time to edit your post to add the information that you are looking for. It'll make your question more readable, and may lead to better answers. Answer: This is a math question, not a programming question. Answer: There are an infinite number of solutions. Consider the set of integers $S=\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,20\\}$. Then there are $21$ subsets of $S$, and each subset has a sum. For example, $S=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ has a sum of $10$. A subset $S'$ of $S$ is \\em{proper} if $S'\\not=S$. For example, $\\{1,2\\}$ is a proper subset of $S$. A partition is a collection of subsets of $S$ that together make $S$ a disjoint union of subsets. That is, if $S'=\\{S_1,S_2,\\ldots,S_m\\}$ is a partition, then $S=S_1\\cup S_2\\cup\\cdots\\cup S_m$ is a disjoint union of subsets.

Answer: \\begin{itemize} \\item Compute the greatest integer less than $x$ (this is the floor function). \\item Subtract $19$ from that number. \\item Divide that number by $19$. \\item Add the original number (the integer part) to the quotient (the fractional part). \\item Subtract $1$ from that number. \\end{itemize} Answer: Let $a = \\lfloor x \\rfloor$, $b = \\lfloor \\frac{x}{19} \\rfloor$, $c = \\lfloor \\frac{x}{19} \\rfloor - 1$. Then the equation is $$a - 19 b + b - 1 = 0$$ which is the same as $$a - 19 b = 0$$ and $$b = \\frac{a}{19}$$ so $b = \\frac{9}{19}$ and $c = \\frac{1}{19}$.

In Mathopolis, an adult is a person 21 years of age or older and a child is a person under 21 years of age. Exactly half of the adults in Mathopolis are female, and exactly half of the female adults have exactly one biological child. Nobody has more than one biological child. In the following, a person is called a male if he is male and a person is called a female if she is female. 1. If a person is female and has a child, what is the probability that the child is male? 2. If a person is female and does not have a child, what is the probability that the person is married? 3. If a person is male and has a child, what is the probability that the person is married? 4. If a person is female and does not have a child, what is the probability that the person is married? 5. If a person is male and does not have a child, what is the probability that the person is married? Answer: 1) The probability that a person has a child is $1/2$. The probability that a person is female is also $1/2$. The probability that a person is female and has a child is $1/4$. 2) The probability that a person is married is $1/2$. 3) The probability that a person is female and has a child is $1/2$. The probability that a person is female and does not have a child is $1/4$. The probability that a person is female and has a child and is married is $1/8$. 4) The probability that a person is female and does not have a child is $1/4$. The probability that a person is female and has a child and is married is $1/8$. 5) The probability that a person is female and does not have a child is $1/4$. The probability that a person is female and has a child and is married is $1/8$. Comment: I want to see the original problem. Answer: Let $A$ be the event that a person has a child, and let $B$ be the event that a person is female. Then $A\\cap B$ is the event that a person has a child and is female, and $$P(A\\cap B)=P(A|B)P(B)=1/2\\times1/2=1/4$$ Let $C$ be the event that a person is married, and let $D$ be the event that a person has a child and is married. Then $C\\cap D$ is the event that\n\nGold Answer:\n-1"
