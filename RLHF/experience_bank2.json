The maximum number of blocks that can be taken is 110. The reason is as follows: When $N = 1$, then he may take all the blocks from each stack. When $N = 2$, then he may take 1 block from each stack. When $N = 3$, then he may take 2 blocks from each stack. When $N = 4$, then he may take 3 blocks from each stack. When $N = 5$, then he may take 4 blocks from each stack. When $N = 6$, then he may take 5 blocks from each stack. When $N = 7$, then he may take 6 blocks from each stack. When $N = 8$, then he may take 7 blocks from each stack. When $N = 9$, then he may take 8 blocks from each stack. When $N = 10$, then he may take 9 blocks from each stack. When $N = 11$, then he may take 10 blocks from each stack. When $N = 12$, then he may take 11 blocks from each stack. When $N = 13$, then he may take 12 blocks from each stack. When $N = 14$, then he may take 13 blocks from each stack. When $N = 15$, then he may take 14 blocks from each stack. When $N = 16$, then he may take 15 blocks from each stack. When $N = 17$, then he may take 16 blocks from each stack.
